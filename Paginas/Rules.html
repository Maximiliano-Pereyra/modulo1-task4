            <h5>IHF rules shall govern MDHL play except as modified herein.</h5>

            <h4>SPORTSMANSHIP</h4>
            <h5>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
                youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
                team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
                this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</h5>
            <h4>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    DIMENSIONS.
                    <h5>IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within
                        a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be
                        adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older</h5>

                        minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                        assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                        whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                        from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
